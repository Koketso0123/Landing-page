  <P id='tribute-info'>Insecure in her skin like a pearl pinned a girl on her skin.She's so gone thats so over now.You can look but you cant see the girl you used to know.Here i am .This is me,and i'm stronger than you ever thought i'd be.Are you shocked.Are you mad that your missing out in who i really am.Now it looks like the jokes on you 'cause the girl that you thought you knew.</P>
